      <h1>Personas and Storyboarding- Microwave</h1>
      <p>
        This assignment explores how different users interact with different
        public interfaces. This case study looks at a microwave in a residential
        dorm kitchen, analyzing its interface, and observing how people interact
        with it. The project looks at three different personas, eventually
        focusing on two trying to map their emotions, thoughts, actions, and
        words, and then a storyboard plot of one user using the microwave
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This project focuses on analyzing user interactions with public
        microwaves. Through observations and interviews, I identified key
        usability challenges and developed personas to represent different user
        needs. The goal is to explore design improvements that enhance microwave
        usability.

      <h2>Observations & Key Findings</h2>
      <p>
        After conducting interviews, observing users, and deploying contextual
        inquiries, I noticed the following patterns with users using this
        microwave:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Most users prefer using the <b>+30 sec</b> button rather than manually
          setting time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preset functions (e.g., <b>defrost</b>) are rarely trusted or used
          correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users avoid adjusting <b>power settings</b> due to lack of clarity and
          also ease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Common issues include <b>uneven heating</b> and
          <b>confusing button labels</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Uses the microwave almost daily.</li>
          <li>
            Relies on <b>+30 sec</b> button instead of setting a specific time.

          <li>Never adjusts power settings.</li>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Prefers inputting time manually but often adds <b>+30 sec</b> for
            adjustments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Occasionally experiments with power settings but finds them
            <b>unclear.</b>

          <li>Does not trust the defrost preset.</li>

          <li>
            Prefers quick-start functions like <b>+30 sec</b>rather than setting
            a specific time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finds presets interesting but does not trust them, usually sticks to
            simple heating.
